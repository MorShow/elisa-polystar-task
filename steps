Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Basic workflow (please, run with these numbers of ports):
1. python server.py -file_path="frankenstein.txt" -port=5001 (run the first server)
2. python server.py -file_path="dracula.txt" -port=5002 (run the second server)
3. python client.py (run the client)

Tests:
(this didn`t work with my pip dependencies (initial configuration), but worked in conda environment, I don`t know why)
pytest test_client.py
